# Requirements
- Web Browser (to view application on your local machine)

+ Preferred
- Visual Studio Code (or any software that allows you to host the index.html file)
<h5>
    - Note: Due to my code having an API KEY not listed in the repository (for security reasons)
    you can provide a key from OpenWeather API straight into the script.js (on the variable: 
    "apiKey" as a string) file in order to run locally without a live server.

    The API Key provided by OpenWeather API takes some time (about 30 minutes) to activate and
    be ready to use
</h5>

# Steps
- Download and extract repository
- Open extracted folder
- Open index.html in your browser or live server
